Element: API
============

###### Element: API

Maybe (unnecessary) layer for handling request. Let's have it around for a while.
It passes Request to the Handler, depending on accept it requests for the Responder.

> **Hint:** Server invokes only one API per request, but API could call another API.

**Respond and enjoy!**
